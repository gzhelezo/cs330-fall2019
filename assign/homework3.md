# Chapter 4 Homework

### Problem 1 (10 pts)
What is the difference between routing and forwarding?

### Problem 2 (10 pts)
Visit a host that uses DHCP to obtain its IP address, network mask, default router, and IP address of its local DNS server. List these values.

### Problem 3 (10 pts) 
Suppose Host A sends Host B a TCP segment encapsulated in an IP datagram. When Host B receives the datagram, how does the network layer in Host B know it should pass the segment (that is, the payload of the datagram) to TCP rather than to UDP or to something else?

### Problem 4 (10 pts)
Compare and contrast the IPv4 and the IPv6 header fields. Do they have any fields in common?

### Problem 5 (10 pts)
Consider sending a 2400-byte datagram into a link that has an MTU of 700 bytes. Suppose the original datagram is stamped with the identification number 422. How many fragments are generated? What are the values in the various fields in the IP datagram(s) generated related to fragmentation?
