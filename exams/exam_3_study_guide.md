#### Network Layer
- Understand what services are provided by the Network Layer Protocol.
- Know the key functions of the Network Layer Protocol.  
- Comprehend IP Addressing and logical subdivision of IP networks. Study how CIDR works.
- Understand DHCP, its operation (also known as session) and services.
- Know how to build a routing forwarding table.
- Know what network device uses TTL.
- Differences between IPv4 and Ipv6 and understand how to bridge between Ipv4 to IPv6.
- Know what switching fabric is, different types and differences between them. 
- Understand IP fragmentation and reassembly.
- Why we have Intra-AS and Inter-AS routing?
- Know how Traceroute uses ICMP to find path from one host to another. 
- Make sure you can do both routing algorithms – Link State Algorithms (Dijkstra) and distance vector (Bellman-Ford).
  - [Dijkstra's Algorithm](../slides/lecture7_network_layer_internet_routing_awnsers.pdf)

- Initialization Vector (IV) when using cipher block chaining?
- What is a nounce?
- What type of attack can be used against a Diﬃe-Hellman key exchange?
- Why might a network administrator distribute multiple IDS sensors throughout a network instead of using a single device?  
- Know the difference between a stateless ﬁrewall and a stateful ﬁrewall.
- What is a cryptographic hash function and its properties?


Exams
-----------------

<strong>Exams will be open-book, closed-notes.</strong> They will last approximately 60 minutes and will be administered at the beginning of the class period.

<strong>Exams may include a programming component.</strong> The last half of the class may be used for instruction and/or laboratory work. 
<strong>A total of three exams will be administered. The lowest scoring exam will be dropped!</strong>

<strong>No make-up exams will be given without approval of the instructor prior to class unless proof of extreme emergency or illness is provided.</strong>
